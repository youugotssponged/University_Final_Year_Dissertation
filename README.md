# EHU Final Year Project / R&D Dissertation 
Is Unity D.O.T.S worth using from a developer perspective?

# What is this Project about?
This Project Artefact of utilising Unity D.O.T.S (ECS, C# Job System and Burst Compiler) has looked into seeing the optimisation capabilities of Unity's new D.O.T.S framework / tech stack to see whether or not from a developer's point of view is worth utilising and learning to increase performance of their game as a Development Method?

# What does this Project Contain?
This Project contains various prototypes both using Traditional Methods of Optimisation (For Speed) and prototypes utilising the Data-Oriented-Design Approach with Use of ECS, C# Job-System and Burst Compiler. 

These Prototypes have been profiled, tested and compared with each other.
